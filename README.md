## üß≠ Overview
This week focused on learning and implementing the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. You‚Äôll find examples that demonstrate how Java uses classes and objects to create reusable and maintainable code.

## üìå Topics Covered

### Day 1: Classes and Objects
- What are classes and objects?
- Creating custom classes in Java
- Creating and using objects
- Fields and methods

### Day 2: Constructors and `this` Keyword
- Types of constructors (default, parameterized)
- Constructor overloading
- Using the `this` keyword to refer to current class members
- Constructor chaining

### Day 3: Inheritance
- What is inheritance?
- Extending a class using the `extends` keyword
- Using `super` to access parent class members
- Single and multilevel inheritance

### Day 4: Polymorphism (Method Overloading and Overriding)
- Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)
- Runtime polymorphism (method overriding)
- Rules and examples of method overriding
- `@Override` annotation and dynamic method dispatch

### Day 5: Abstraction and Interfaces
- Understanding abstraction
- Abstract classes and methods
- Interfaces and `implements` keyword
- Difference between abstract classes and interfaces
- Multiple interface implementation

### Day 6: Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
- What is encapsulation?
- Using getters and setters
- Private variables and public methods
- Access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`, default)

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java syntax (Week 1 topics)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A code editor or IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

## üìÇ How to Use This Repository
The repository is organized into folders for each day. Each folder contains code examples and practice files for the topic of the day. You can open these files in your IDE, compile and run them, and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding.
